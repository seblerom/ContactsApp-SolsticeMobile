Code Challenge - Contacts Application.
Developer: Sebastian Leon

+ Simple design interface With a navigation controller > table view controller > view controller.
+ Constraints added and tested for PORTRAIT in iPhone 5 and iPad (3rd generation).
+ Pods library dependency manager installed.
+ Establishing request to the endpoint provided through AFnetworking library.
+ Model created for Contact, Contact detail, phone and address.
+ Caching images to save network request.
+ Decided not to use core data to save contacts information because in my opinion is not what challenge was about. (I could've done it if I wanted too)
